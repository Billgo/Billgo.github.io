One of the first lessons you learn as a young traveler is when you go to a faraway country: avoid the people that call you on the street. “Massage?” “Hungry?” “Need a guide?” Only noobs follow the hustlers. You find a quiet spot and research where to go. Then you go there and then go further. Same thing when you travel on the Web. Don’t get lured in. Find a quiet spot and research and then go there. And then go further.

Relevant things are not pushed at us. They are not new or breaking and easily forgotten. Meaningful insights are found, and they are remembered. They can be years old but they’re never yesterday’s new, they are why-didn’t-I-know-that-already kind of insights. And they are worth re-reading. Things pushed in our stream through an algorithm tailored to our weakness are the digital equivalent of the calls that try to lure you in when you walking down a street in Bangkok.

## What happened to blogging ?

Blogging was always a bit uncool. Lots of people claim that they invented it and everyone has their indisputable definition. The common one is that blog comes from weB-LOG. The first time I heard of blogs I remember that they were explained as “b-log”, meaning “browsing log”—a list of sites we browsed. After listing the browsed sites, b-loggers commented on what they had read and uploaded that list to their personal site. The logs and comments were again browsed and logged and commented on by others. Like Chinese Whispers. Or like Twitter. Or like a Virus. Or like human communication translated to the screen.

As these meta-comments grew in their meta potency, blogs became more than the sum of their comments. Blogs slowly turned into everyone’s personal interactive newsfeed. With the help of RSS, everybody could put together their own news, composed of their favorite independent writers… by 2005, everything you published on a site was called blogging.

Self-publishing was perceived as a radical concept at the time. Corporations were worried. “We can’t control market communication.” PR companies were confused. “How can we use this to shape the narrative.” Politicians were scared. “So much public opinion!” Journalists felt safe but wondered what would happen “if everyone can just write what they think.” Bloggers thought that they were oiling the hinge of a turning point in human history. No one could have foreseen that in a couple of years this cosm of private sites would implode into five commercial black holes and turn the Web into the opposite of what it promised to be.

With the help of Facebook, Google, trolls, AI, bot farms, click farms, persona software, blind hate, cold propaganda, hot ideology and good old greed the tables have been turned. Philosophically speaking, Social Media is a mental prison where Facebook exists to make us believe that Google is still open. (It is not.)

> Disneyland is there to conceal the fact that it is the “real” country, all of “real” America, which is Disneyland (just as prisons are there to conceal the fact that it is the social in its entirety, in its banal omnipresence, which is carceral). Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation. It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology), but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle. –Jean Baudrillard, Simulacrum and Simulacra

In a bit more than ten years, open became closed, blog became PR, hoodie became suit and Ping Pong turned into golf. That’s how revolutions work. Re-volutions tend to lead back to where they started. The French revolution started with the head of the King rolling and ended with a new Caesar tearing the crown out of the Popes own hands. The Industrial Revolution, supposedly making our lives easier, lead into one of the most exploitative centuries of human History before catalyzing an apocalyptic War machine in the 20th and boiling the planet in the 21st century. The Russian revolution started with the hope of giving power to the people and installed to one of the bloodiest Czars they could imagine. The Chinese revolution was supposed to end the age of Empires and opened the palace doors one of the most tyrannical Emperors in Human history. To top it all, capitalists start praising communist China as a role-model for the West.

At first, the word “blog” didn’t sound like much of a revolution. It sounded cheap, dumb and weak. Blog, blob, flop… It still sounds a bit self-made, though the World’s top ten consulting companies now all run their own blogs. When you hear “blog” these days, it has the charm of a digital hobby radio operator. It sounds more like “computer”, “website”, or “FTP”. It sounds a bit old, it has a touch of steampunk.
